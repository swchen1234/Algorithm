## backtracking


Backtracking is a general algorithm for finding all (or some) solutions to some computational problems, notably constraint satisfaction problems, that incrementally builds candidates to the solutions, and abandons a candidate ("backtracks") as soon as it determines that the candidate cannot possibly be completed to a valid solution.

Classic backtracking problem includes "eight queens" problem, where try to place eight queens on a chess board and no more than two queens share the same row, column and diagonal.
